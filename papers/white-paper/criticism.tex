\subsection{Criticism}

We can never validate whether a model is true. In practice, ``all
models are wrong'' \citep{box1976science}. However, we can try to
uncover where the model goes wrong. Model criticism helps justify the
model as an approximation or point to good directions for revising the
model.

Edward explores model criticism using
\begin{itemize}
  \item point-based evaluations, such as mean squared error or
  classification accuracy;
  \item posterior predictive checks, for making probabilistic
  assessments of the model fit using discrepancy functions.
\end{itemize}

We describe them in detail below.
